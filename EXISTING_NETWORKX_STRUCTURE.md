# EXISTING_NETWORKX_STRUCTURE

## 1. Legacy Oracle

- Root: /dp/franken_networkx/legacy_networkx_code/networkx
- Upstream: networkx/networkx

## 2. Subsystem Map

- networkx/classes: Graph, DiGraph, MultiGraph classes and views.
- networkx/algorithms/*: flow, shortest paths, components, centrality, isomorphism, traversal, matching, etc.
- networkx/generators: graph construction families.
- networkx/convert.py + convert_matrix.py + relabel.py: ingestion and conversion.
- networkx/readwrite: serialization formats and adapters.
- networkx/utils: decorators, backend dispatch, random utilities, union-find.
- networkx/lazy_imports.py: optional dependency behavior.

## 3. Semantic Hotspots (Must Preserve)

1. adjacency dict structure and mutable attribute alias behavior.
2. directed vs undirected and multigraph key semantics.
3. live view behavior from coreviews/reportviews.
4. dispatchable decorator routing and backend priority handling.
5. conversion behavior across dict/list/matrix/graph inputs.
6. deterministic tie-break and ordering behavior in scoped algorithms.

## 4. Compatibility-Critical Behaviors

- Graph/DiGraph/MultiGraph mutation and edge lookup contracts.
- backend priority and runtime backend selection behavior.
- open_file decompression convenience behavior in read/write paths.
- lazy import failure timing and error surface shape.

## 5. Security and Stability Risk Areas

- GraphML XML parser trust boundary and untrusted input risk.
- GML parsing and destringizer/stringizer edge behavior.
- backend override ambiguity and silent route changes.
- compressed file handling and parser robustness.

## 6. V1 Extraction Boundary

Include now:
- classes + views + dispatchable infrastructure, conversion/relabel, core algorithm families, and scoped read/write formats.

Exclude for V1:
- drawing/matplotlib ecosystem, heavy linalg optional paths, full plugin backend breadth.

## 7. High-Value Conformance Fixture Families

- classes/tests for storage and view semantics.
- algorithms/*/tests for flow/connectivity/path/isomorphism scopes.
- generators/tests for deterministic graph creation behavior.
- readwrite/tests for format round-trip and warning behaviors.
- utils/tests for dispatch/backends/decorator/lazy import semantics.

## 8. Extraction Notes for Rust Spec

- Land graph core and view semantics before algorithm breadth.
- Treat dispatch/backends as compatibility-critical infrastructure.
- Make deterministic ordering rules explicit in each algorithm family contract.
