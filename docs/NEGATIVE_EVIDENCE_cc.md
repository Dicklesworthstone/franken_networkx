# Measured Head-to-Head Evidence — cc (CopperCliff)

Verify/gauntlet phase: every recent `code-first batch-test pending` optimization
built into a fresh release wheel (`maturin build --release`, clean .so verified
`nm -D | grep crossbeam == 0`, installed at HEAD) and measured **head-to-head vs
NetworkX** on realistic workloads (warm, min-of-8). Honest numbers — wins, losses,
neutrals. Losses get reverted; conformance stays green.

Build: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/franken_networkx-cc maturin build --release -m crates/fnx-python/Cargo.toml` → wheel installed. Measured 2026-06-18.

## Results

| Optimization | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio (nx/fnx) | Verdict | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **laplacian_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 6.53ms | 8.65ms | **1.32x** | WIN | keep (was 0.47x BEFORE gate — real reversal) |
| **adjacency_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 8.49ms | 337.2ms | **39.7x** | WIN | keep |
| **modularity_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 12.0ms | 216.0ms | **18.0x** | WIN | keep |
| **gutman_index native routing** | conn(200) | 5.43ms | 11.73ms | **2.16x** | WIN | keep |
| **schultz_index native routing** | conn(200) | 5.44ms | 11.96ms | **2.20x** | WIN | keep |
| **generalized_degree native routing** | conn(400) | 0.60ms | 1.93ms | **3.23x** | WIN | keep |
| **google_matrix native routing** | gnp(500,.05) digraph | 15.58ms | 5.46ms | **0.34x** | **LOSS** | **REVERT** (kernel returns list-of-lists; np.asarray conversion dominates. Old Python path = 0.80x, much better. Keep the separate dangling-redistribution BUG FIX.) |

## Pre-existing losses surfaced by profiling (not cc optimizations — to investigate/file)

| Function | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dijkstra_path(u,v) single-pair | gnp(400,.04) | 1.16ms | 0.57ms | **0.49x** | single-pair likely pays full fnx->nx conversion or weighted-setup overhead while unweighted shortest_path (2.47x) / astar (6.34x) WIN. Candidate: in-process single-pair dijkstra. FILE. |
| max_weight_matching | gnp(300,.05) weighted | 86ms | 81ms | 0.94x | order-blocked native kernel (kpnc8); marginal, known. |

## Eigensolver-gate detail (the headline reversal)

`symmetric_eigvals_rust` (safe-Rust eig) was used unconditionally on the general
dense path of laplacian/adjacency/modularity_spectrum. Profiled crossover n=30..300:
it is **2.3-4x slower than np.linalg.eigvalsh (LAPACK) at EVERY n**, identical
eigenvalues (1e-7) + identical ascending order. laplacian_spectrum was **2.4x
SLOWER than nx** because of it. Gate (n<=64 safe-Rust, LAPACK above) → measured
**1.32x WIN**. The other two were already winning (nx runs non-Hermitian dgeev);
the gate widened the margin. Commits 1f2338b8a + 6e8dd288d.
