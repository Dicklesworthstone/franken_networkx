# Measured Head-to-Head Evidence — cc (CopperCliff)

Verify/gauntlet phase: every recent `code-first batch-test pending` optimization
built into a fresh release wheel (`maturin build --release`, clean .so verified
`nm -D | grep crossbeam == 0`, installed at HEAD) and measured **head-to-head vs
NetworkX** on realistic workloads (warm, min-of-8). Honest numbers — wins, losses,
neutrals. Losses get reverted; conformance stays green.

Build: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/franken_networkx-cc maturin build --release -m crates/fnx-python/Cargo.toml` → wheel installed. Measured 2026-06-18.

## Results

| Optimization | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio (nx/fnx) | Verdict | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **laplacian_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 6.53ms | 8.65ms | **1.32x** | WIN | keep (was 0.47x BEFORE gate — real reversal) |
| **adjacency_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 8.49ms | 337.2ms | **39.7x** | WIN | keep |
| **modularity_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 12.0ms | 216.0ms | **18.0x** | WIN | keep |
| **gutman_index native routing** | conn(200) | 5.43ms | 11.73ms | **2.16x** | WIN | keep |
| **schultz_index native routing** | conn(200) | 5.44ms | 11.96ms | **2.20x** | WIN | keep |
| **generalized_degree native routing** | conn(400) | 0.60ms | 1.93ms | **3.23x** | WIN | keep |
| **google_matrix native routing** | gnp(500,.05) digraph | 15.58ms | 5.46ms | **0.34x** | **LOSS** | **REVERT** (kernel returns list-of-lists; np.asarray conversion dominates. Old Python path = 0.80x, much better. Keep the separate dangling-redistribution BUG FIX.) |

## Pre-existing losses surfaced by profiling (not cc optimizations — to investigate/file)

| Function | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dijkstra_path(u,v) single-pair WEIGHTED | gnp(400,.04) wt | 5.85ms | 0.72ms | **0.12x** | DIAGNOSED + FILED br-r37-c1-j5u29. ROOT CAUSE: fnx `_raw_dijkstra_path` computes the FULL single-source SSSP (fnx dijkstra_path time ~= single_source time) then extracts path; nx early-TERMINATES when target is popped from heap. dijkstra_path_length same (4x). bidirectional_dijkstra (2.29ms) better but still 3x nx. Needs target-aware early-exit native dijkstra (Rust kernel, fnx-algorithms). Values already match nx. |
| max_weight_matching | gnp(300,.05) weighted | 86ms | 81ms | 0.94x | order-blocked native kernel (kpnc8); marginal, known. |

## Link-prediction scorers (CrimsonRiver 9142-9152) — measured (explicit ebunch 2000 pairs, gnp(800,.03))

| Scorer | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| jaccard_coefficient | 7.50ms | 11.47ms | 1.53x | WIN |
| common_neighbor_centrality | 76.7ms | 205.8ms | 2.68x | WIN |
| adamic_adar_index | 5.28ms | 5.03ms | 0.95x | NEUTRAL |
| resource_allocation_index | 5.22ms | 5.00ms | 0.96x | NEUTRAL |
| **preferential_attachment** | 2.61ms | 1.43ms | **0.55x** | **LOSS** |

preferential_attachment (1.8x slower, persists at scale) is the simplest scorer
(deg(u)*deg(v)); nx is a trivial Python degree product. fnx's path (CrimsonRiver
9142 raw kernel) is slower — likely binding/per-pair overhead exceeding nx's
lightweight loop. CrimsonRiver's area (flagged via mail). Not a cc file.

## Generators (batch/native optimizations) — measured vs nx (warm min-of-5)

| Generator | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gnp_random_graph(800,.02) | 9.76ms | 23.16ms | 2.37x | WIN |
| random_geometric_graph(500,.1) | 1.38ms | 3.30ms | 2.38x | WIN |
| barabasi_albert(800,5) | 3.87ms | 5.05ms | 1.31x | WIN |
| watts_strogatz(800,6,.1) | 1.59ms | 1.78ms | 1.12x | WIN |
| gnm_random_graph(500,4000) | 3.93ms | 4.21ms | 1.07x | NEUTRAL |
| dual_barabasi_albert(800) | 3.31ms | 3.16ms | 0.95x | NEUTRAL |
| waxman_graph(400) | 31.1ms | 27.2ms | 0.87x | LOSS (marginal) |

waxman 0.87x: the batch optimization (memory: "3.8x") was a SELF-speedup vs the old
per-edge add_edge path, NOT vs nx — vs nx it's marginally slower (residual O(n^2)
distance compute + construction). Batch stays (better than per-edge); not a revert.

## Construction folds (with_mirror) — measured NEUTRAL-to-LOSS vs nx (substrate tax)

Attributed graph n=2000 (node attrs + edge attrs), warm min-of-6:

| Fold | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subgraph().copy() | 8.46ms | 7.79ms | 0.92x | NEUTRAL |
| G.copy() | 10.06ms | 9.83ms | 0.98x | NEUTRAL |
| to_directed() | 44.92ms | 37.45ms | 0.83x | LOSS |
| to_undirected() | 102.24ms | 60.31ms | 0.59x | LOSS |

**Do NOT revert**: the with_mirror folds collapsed a double dict-crossing into one
pass — strictly <= the pre-fold cost (self-improvement, byte-identical). The
vs-nx loss is the **construction substrate tax** (per-node/edge PyDict alloc +
PyO3 label round-trips), NOT the folds. to_undirected (0.59x) additionally pays
the reciprocal-edge merge — CrimsonRiver's tbh4q lazy-AttrMap lever (in progress).
RELEASE NOTE: attributed graph construction/conversion is fnx's weakest area vs nx;
it is the substrate-tax frontier, not a routing/algorithm gap.

## Eigensolver-gate detail (the headline reversal)

`symmetric_eigvals_rust` (safe-Rust eig) was used unconditionally on the general
dense path of laplacian/adjacency/modularity_spectrum. Profiled crossover n=30..300:
it is **2.3-4x slower than np.linalg.eigvalsh (LAPACK) at EVERY n**, identical
eigenvalues (1e-7) + identical ascending order. laplacian_spectrum was **2.4x
SLOWER than nx** because of it. Gate (n<=64 safe-Rust, LAPACK above) → measured
**1.32x WIN**. The other two were already winning (nx runs non-Hermitian dgeev);
the gate widened the margin. Commits 1f2338b8a + 6e8dd288d.
