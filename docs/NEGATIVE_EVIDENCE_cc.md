# Measured Head-to-Head Evidence — cc (CopperCliff)

Verify/gauntlet phase: every recent `code-first batch-test pending` optimization
built into a fresh release wheel (`maturin build --release`, clean .so verified
`nm -D | grep crossbeam == 0`, installed at HEAD) and measured **head-to-head vs
NetworkX** on realistic workloads (warm, min-of-8). Honest numbers — wins, losses,
neutrals. Losses get reverted; conformance stays green.

Build: `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/franken_networkx-cc maturin build --release -m crates/fnx-python/Cargo.toml` → wheel installed. Measured 2026-06-18.

## Results

| Optimization | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio (nx/fnx) | Verdict | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **laplacian_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 6.53ms | 8.65ms | **1.32x** | WIN | keep (was 0.47x BEFORE gate — real reversal) |
| **adjacency_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 8.49ms | 337.2ms | **39.7x** | WIN | keep |
| **modularity_spectrum eigensolver n-gate** | gnp(300,.05) | 12.0ms | 216.0ms | **18.0x** | WIN | keep |

| ~~google_matrix native routing~~ REVERTED | gnp(500,.05) digraph | 15.58ms->3.31ms | 5.46ms->3.06ms | 0.34x->**0.93x** | **REVERTED 30d99dcaf** | DONE — removed routing, numpy path restored (0.78x@200/0.93x@500, up from 0.34x). Dangling bug fix retained, conformance 58 pass. |

## Pre-existing losses surfaced by profiling (not cc optimizations — to investigate/file)

| Function | Workload | fnx | nx | ratio | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| dijkstra_path(u,v) single-pair WEIGHTED | gnp(400,.04) wt | 5.85ms | 0.72ms | **0.12x** | DIAGNOSED + FILED br-r37-c1-j5u29. ROOT CAUSE: fnx `_raw_dijkstra_path` computes the FULL single-source SSSP (fnx dijkstra_path time ~= single_source time) then extracts path; nx early-TERMINATES when target is popped from heap. dijkstra_path_length same (4x). bidirectional_dijkstra (2.29ms) better but still 3x nx. Needs target-aware early-exit native dijkstra (Rust kernel, fnx-algorithms). Values already match nx. |
| max_weight_matching | gnp(300,.05) weighted | 86ms | 81ms | 0.94x | order-blocked native kernel (kpnc8); marginal, known. |

## Link-prediction scorers (CrimsonRiver 9142-9152) — measured (explicit ebunch 2000 pairs, gnp(800,.03))

| Scorer | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| jaccard_coefficient | 7.50ms | 11.47ms | 1.53x | WIN |
| common_neighbor_centrality | 76.7ms | 205.8ms | 2.68x | WIN |
| adamic_adar_index | 5.28ms | 5.03ms | 0.95x | NEUTRAL |
| resource_allocation_index | 5.22ms | 5.00ms | 0.96x | NEUTRAL |
| **preferential_attachment** | 2.61ms | 1.43ms | **0.55x** | **LOSS** |

preferential_attachment (1.8x slower, persists at scale) is the simplest scorer
(deg(u)*deg(v)); nx is a trivial Python degree product. fnx's path (CrimsonRiver
9142 raw kernel) is slower — likely binding/per-pair overhead exceeding nx's
lightweight loop. CrimsonRiver's area (flagged via mail). Not a cc file.

## Generators (batch/native optimizations) — measured vs nx (warm min-of-5)

| Generator | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| gnp_random_graph(800,.02) | 9.76ms | 23.16ms | 2.37x | WIN |
| random_geometric_graph(500,.1) | 1.38ms | 3.30ms | 2.38x | WIN |
| barabasi_albert(800,5) | 3.87ms | 5.05ms | 1.31x | WIN |
| watts_strogatz(800,6,.1) | 1.59ms | 1.78ms | 1.12x | WIN |
| gnm_random_graph(500,4000) | 3.93ms | 4.21ms | 1.07x | NEUTRAL |
| dual_barabasi_albert(800) | 3.31ms | 3.16ms | 0.95x | NEUTRAL |
| waxman_graph(400) | 31.1ms | 27.2ms | 0.87x | LOSS (marginal) |

waxman 0.87x: the batch optimization (memory: "3.8x") was a SELF-speedup vs the old
per-edge add_edge path, NOT vs nx — vs nx it's marginally slower (residual O(n^2)
distance compute + construction). Batch stays (better than per-edge); not a revert.

## IO / export — measured vs nx (gnp(1500,.01), warm min-of-5)

| Function | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| to_scipy_sparse_array | 2.40ms | 6.29ms | 2.62x | WIN |
| to_dict_of_lists | 1.10ms | 2.08ms | 1.90x | WIN |
| to_dict_of_dicts | 0.24ms | 0.28ms | 1.15x | WIN |
| generate_edgelist | 5.90ms | 5.95ms | 1.01x | NEUTRAL |
| generate_adjlist | 1.85ms | 1.83ms | 0.99x | NEUTRAL |
| node_link_data | 2.37ms | 3.39ms | 1.43x | WIN (corrected: earlier 0.61x was cold-measurement NOISE; clean warm min-of-8 = 1.24x no-attrs / 1.43x attrs) |

node_link_data is a WIN (correction): edges(data=True) is at PARITY with nx
(3.26ms vs 3.30ms, inherent O(E)), and clean re-measurement of node_link_data
shows 1.24-1.43x WIN. The earlier 0.61x was a noisy cold measurement — HONEST
CORRECTION. Lesson: warm min-of-8, not min-of-5, for these.

## dijkstra_path early-exit — confirmed (near vs far target)

nx dijkstra_path NEAR 0.72ms / FAR 1.60ms (2.2x — strong target early-exit). fnx
dijkstra_path NEAR 2.68ms / FAR 3.32ms (~flat = full SSSP, no early-exit).
bidirectional_dijkstra flat 2.39ms (explores both ends). Confirms j5u29: needs a
forward target-early-exit native dijkstra with path-parity tie-breaking.

## Construction folds (with_mirror) — measured NEUTRAL-to-LOSS vs nx (substrate tax)

Attributed graph n=2000 (node attrs + edge attrs), warm min-of-6:

| Fold | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| subgraph().copy() | 7.78ms | 6.26ms | 0.80x->? | was LOSS; copy() now 2.14x after bjomp deepcopy fast-path |
| G.copy() | 4.10ms | 8.77ms | **2.14x** | **WIN** (bjomp deepcopy fast-path) |
| to_directed() | 24.38ms | 27.91ms | **1.14x** | **FIXED -> WIN** (bjomp immutable-attr deepcopy fast-path, 6f9854787) |
| to_undirected() | 45.73ms | 56.80ms | **1.24x** | **FIXED -> WIN** (bjomp, 6f9854787) |

**RESOLVED (bjomp, commit 6f9854787)**: the dominant construction cost was
_native_to_directed_deepcopy round-tripping to Python copy.deepcopy per attr dict
(cProfile: 918k calls = 1.38s/1.88s). Fast-pathing all-immutable-scalar dicts to a
shallow dict.copy() (semantically identical; immutables never copied) REVERSED the
losses to WINS: to_directed 0.75x->1.14x, to_undirected 0.71x->1.24x, copy
0.98x->2.14x. 694 construction conformance cases pass; nested-mutable stays DEEP.
fnx's former weakest area now BEATS nx. (Subgraph .copy() also benefits.) The
residual reciprocal-edge-merge tax in to_undirected is CrimsonRiver's tbh4q.

## Graph operators — measured vs nx (attributed gnp(1500), warm min-of-6)

| Operator | fnx | nx | ratio | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| complement | 16.5ms | 43.9ms | 2.66x | WIN |
| cartesian_product | 1.72ms | 4.06ms | 2.37x | WIN |
| disjoint_union | 19.7ms | 22.2ms | 1.13x | WIN |
| union (rename) | 35.8ms | 23.2ms | 0.65x | LOSS |
| compose | 18.6ms | 9.1ms | 0.49x | LOSS |
| relabel_nodes | 11.6ms | 4.8ms | 0.41x | LOSS |

CONSTRUCTION-SUBSTRATE FRONTIER (consolidated): the operator + construction LOSSES
all share one root — per-node/edge PyO3 materialization + slow native build/clone
methods, NOT algorithm gaps:
- relabel_nodes 0.41x: per-node label PyO3 round-trips (native clone+rename was
  attempted + reverted 2026-06-09 — correct but 1.33x slower, parity-bound by the
  same round-trips).
- compose 0.49x: routes to native _native_compose (cProfile: 100% there). Rust
  read (lib.rs:9170) confirms the cost is per-node `py_node_key(py, node)` creation
  + per-node/edge `attrs.bind(py).copy()` (shallow Python mirror) + node_attrs
  clone — i.e. the per-node PyO3 MATERIALIZATION WALL, not a removable copy.deepcopy
  (so bjomp's trick does NOT apply). Same root as relabel + MultiGraph.copy.
- union 0.65x: union_all construction tax.
- MultiGraph.copy 0.45x (jelx1), __deepcopy__ walk (489mp).
This is fnx's residual weak frontier. Algorithms/spectral/centrality/IO DOMINATE
(13-1031x); the substrate is where the remaining vs-nx losses live. bjomp proved
the substrate CAN be beaten where the cost is copy.deepcopy (to_directed/copy now
WIN); the rest are the per-node PyO3 materialization wall (py_node_key + attr-mirror
crossing per node/edge), Rust-confirmed in _native_compose/_native_copy. That wall
is a fundamental substrate redesign (avoid materializing a Python label object +
attr dict per node), NOT a quick fix — bjomp only worked because copy.deepcopy was
a REMOVABLE cost layered on top. This is the honest floor of fnx-vs-nx on attributed
construction: fnx pays a Rust<->Python round-trip per node/edge that pure-Python nx
does not.

## MultiGraph.copy() — measured LOSS 0.45x (native inner-clone, separate from deepcopy)

MultiGraph.copy 0.45x vs nx (DiGraph.copy is 1.72x WIN). cProfile: 100% in native
_native_copy (no Python children). ASYMMETRY: PyGraph._native_copy is optimized
(with_mirror single-pass); PyMultiGraph._native_copy just delegates to the generic
copy() — never optimized. Bottleneck is the native MultiGraph inner-structure clone
(keydicts), not node-attr crossing. Filed br-r37-c1-jelx1.

## __deepcopy__ (copy.deepcopy(G)) — PARTIAL fix, still substrate-walk-bound

| Type | fnx | nx | ratio | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DiGraph.deepcopy | 16.7ms | 11.7ms | 0.70x | improved from 0.53x via immutable fast-path (928875302) |
| Graph.deepcopy | 22.8ms | 9.9ms | 0.43x | LOSS |
| MultiGraph.deepcopy | 39.7ms | 15.2ms | 0.38x | LOSS |

The copy.deepcopy fast-path (same lever as bjomp) helps, but __deepcopy__ uses the
Python _graph_deepcopy which WALKS nodes/edges views + out[u][v] per element — the
substrate walk is the residual bottleneck. Unlike copy()/to_directed (now WINS via
the native path), __deepcopy__ has no native same-type deep-copy. Filed br-r37-c1-489mp.

## Eigensolver-gate detail (the headline reversal)

`symmetric_eigvals_rust` (safe-Rust eig) was used unconditionally on the general
dense path of laplacian/adjacency/modularity_spectrum. Profiled crossover n=30..300:
it is **2.3-4x slower than np.linalg.eigvalsh (LAPACK) at EVERY n**, identical
eigenvalues (1e-7) + identical ascending order. laplacian_spectrum was **2.4x
SLOWER than nx** because of it. Gate (n<=64 safe-Rust, LAPACK above) → measured
**1.32x WIN**. The other two were already winning (nx runs non-Hermitian dgeev);
the gate widened the margin. Commits 1f2338b8a + 6e8dd288d.
